# Two Pointer Technique

Question 1: Find Pair with Given Sum
Problem: Given an array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target = 6
Output: [1, 3]

Question 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Problem: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
Input: arr = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Question 3: Container With Most Water
Problem: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container that holds the most water.
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

Question 1: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
Problem: Given an array of integers and a number k, find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.
Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3
Output: 9

Question 2: Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters
Problem: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than k distinct characters.
Input: s = "araaci", k = 2
Output: 4 ("araa")

Question 3: Smallest Subarray with a Given Sum
Problem: Given an array of positive integers and a positive integer S, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to S. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.
Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S = 7
Output: 2 ([5, 2])
